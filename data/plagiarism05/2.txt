Colonialism had a destabilizing effect on what had been a number of ethnic groups that is still being felt in African politics. In the 1870s European nations were bickering over themselves about the spoils of Africa. Between 1870 and World War I alone, the European scramble for Africa resulted in the adding of around one-fifth of the land area of the globe to its overseas colonial possessions. Prior to European influence, national borders were not much of a concern, with Africans generally following the practice of other areas of the world, such as the Arabian peninsula, where a group's territory was congruent with its military or trade influence.
