The echoes of colonialism throughout the world can still be felt in today's global political sphere. In the mid-19th and early 20th centuries, several European nations were in conflict over rights to African land and resources, and eventually "around one-fifth of the land area of the globe" (Global Issues "Conflicts in Africa") was colonized by European nations. One major repercussion of colonialism is in the existence of African borders, which were "not much of a concern" (Wikipedia "Africa: Politics") before Europeans colonized the globe, but are now the cause of much conflict throughout the world.
